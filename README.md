# Easeday-Scrum-Board
This repository manages the Scrum Board for the Easeday Capstone Prototype. It includes project planning, sprint tracking, and backlog management.

Easeday Scrum Board - GitHub Repository
Project Overview
This repository is dedicated to managing the Scrum Board for the Easeday Capstone Prototype. It serves as a central hub for task management, sprint planning, and backlog tracking to ensure an organized and efficient development process. The project follows an Agile Scrum methodology to enhance collaboration and maintain a structured workflow.

Objectives:
Organize project tasks efficiently using GitHub Projects.
Structure sprints to align with project goals and deadlines.
Assign and track tasks based on team responsibilities.
Ensure weekly progress updates through PPP Reports.
Maintain a well-documented and transparent development workflow.
Project Structure
GitHub Projects Board – Used to track all tasks in an Agile framework.
Backlog – Contains all project tasks before they are assigned to a sprint.
Sprints – Weekly development cycles focused on specific deliverables.
PPP Reports – Weekly progress updates for tracking project milestones.
Code Repository – Stores and manages the development files.
Setting Up the Scrum Board
1. Creating the Scrum Board
Navigate to the repository and select Projects.
Click New Project and choose Board View.
Name the project "Easeday Scrum Board".
Add the following columns for task organization:
Backlog – Contains all planned tasks for the project.
To Do – Tasks that have been selected for the current sprint.
In Progress – Tasks currently being worked on.
Review – Tasks requiring feedback or testing before completion.
Done – Successfully completed tasks.
2. Adding Tasks to the Backlog
The Backlog serves as a list of all tasks identified for the project. These tasks will be moved into active sprints as needed.

Example Tasks:
Task Name	Estimated Hours	Notes
Research competitors (Google Calendar, Outlook)	6h	Identify features and analyze competitors.
UI/UX Wireframe Design	10h	Develop initial interface mockups.
Firebase Authentication Setup	8h	Implement Google OAuth login system.
MySQL Database Setup	6h	Define and configure the database schema.
Google Calendar API Integration	12h	Enable real-time synchronization.
Smart Scheduling Algorithm	10h	Implement a task prioritization system.
Guidelines:

Tasks should be logically sequenced (e.g., UI design before front-end development).
Tasks should only be assigned once they are part of an active sprint.
Estimated time should be recorded in hours, not days.
3. Organizing Weekly Sprints
Each sprint follows a one-week cycle, aligning with our weekly team meetings.

Sprint Schedule:
Sprint #	Dates	Tasks Included
Sprint 1	Feb 28 - Mar 6	Research, UI Wireframes, Initial Backend Setup
Sprint 2	Mar 7 - Mar 13	Authentication, Database Setup
Sprint 3	Mar 14 - Mar 20	Google Calendar API Integration, UI Refinements
Sprint 4	Mar 21 - Mar 27	Notification System, Task Scheduling Features
Sprint 5	Mar 28 - Apr 3	Testing & Debugging
Sprint 6	Apr 4 - Apr 10	Final Presentation & Prototype Improvements
Sprint Guidelines:

At the beginning of each sprint, tasks should be moved from Backlog → To Do.
Tasks should be assigned to one team member to ensure accountability.
Each team member should have an estimated workload of approximately 6 hours per week.
4. Assigning and Managing Sprint Tasks
During each sprint, tasks progress through the following stages:

Move tasks from Backlog → To Do at the start of the sprint.
Assign one team member per task to ensure accountability.
Task Status Updates:
To Do – Task is ready to be worked on.
In Progress – Work has started on the task.
Review – Task is pending feedback or testing.
Done – Task has been successfully completed.
Task Priority Levels:

High Priority – Critical tasks necessary for project functionality.
Medium Priority – Features that enhance project usability.
Low Priority – Minor improvements or refinements.
5. Keeping the Scrum Board Updated
The Scrum Board should be reviewed and updated weekly.
Completed tasks should be moved to the Done column.
Team members should log updates regularly to ensure task tracking remains accurate.
Updates from the board will be used to generate PPP Reports.
6. Inviting the Professor to View the Scrum Board
The professor must be invited to access and review the Scrum Board.
