# Easeday Scrum Board - GitHub Repository

## **Project Overview**
This repository is created to manage the **Scrum Board** for our **Easeday Capstone Prototype**. It helps us to:
- Plan and track project tasks
- Organize sprints and weekly progress
- Manage backlog and task assignments
- Follow Agile Scrum methodology

## **Project Structure**
- **GitHub Projects Board** – Used for Scrum task tracking
- **Backlog** – List of all tasks for the project
- **Sprints** – Weekly development cycles
- **PPP Reports** – Weekly updates on progress
- **Code Repository** – Stores and manages development files

---

## **Setting Up the Scrum Board**
### **1. Creating the Scrum Board**
1. Open the repository and go to **Projects**.
2. Click **New Project** → Choose **Board View**.
3. Name it **"Easeday Scrum Board"**.
4. Add the following columns:
   - **Backlog** – All tasks that need to be completed
   - **To Do** – Tasks chosen for the sprint
   - **In Progress** – Tasks currently being worked on
   - **Review** – Tasks awaiting feedback
   - **Done** – Completed tasks

---

### **2. Adding Tasks to the Backlog**
The **Backlog** contains all tasks for the project, which will be moved into sprints as needed.

#### **Example Tasks:**
| Task Name | Estimated Hours | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-------|
| Research competitors (Google Calendar, Outlook) | 6h | Identify features and weaknesses |
| UI/UX Wireframe Design | 10h | Initial interface mockups |
| Firebase Authentication Setup | 8h | Implement Google OAuth login |
| MySQL Database Setup | 6h | Define and configure database schema |
| Google Calendar API Integration | 12h | Enable real-time sync |
| Smart Scheduling Algorithm | 10h | Implement task prioritization |

**Important Rules:**
- Tasks should be **logically ordered** (e.g., UI design before front-end coding).
- Tasks should **only be assigned when moved into a sprint**.
- Time estimates must be in **hours**, not days.

---

### **3. Organizing Weekly Sprints**
Sprints are **one week long**, matching our weekly meetings.

#### **Sprint Schedule:**
| Sprint # | Dates | Tasks Included |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| Sprint 1 | Feb 28 - Mar 6 | Research, UI Wireframes, Initial Backend Setup |
| Sprint 2 | Mar 7 - Mar 13 | Authentication, Database Setup |
| Sprint 3 | Mar 14 - Mar 20 | Google Calendar API Integration, UI Refinements |

| Sprint 5 | Mar 28 - Apr 3 | Testing & Debugging |
| Sprint 6 | Apr 4 - Apr 10 | Final Presentation & Prototype Improvements |

**Sprint Rules:**
- Move tasks from **Backlog → To Do** at the beginning of each sprint.
- Assign tasks **only once they are in a sprint**.
- Each team member should have **around 6 hours of work per week**.

---

### **4. Assigning and Managing Sprint Tasks**
During each sprint, tasks are moved and updated as follows:
1. Move tasks from **Backlog** → **To Do**.
2. Assign **one team member per task**.
3. Update task status:
   - **To Do** – Not started yet
   - **In Progress** – Currently being worked on
   - **Review** – Needs feedback/testing
   - **Done** – Completed

**Task Priority Levels:**
- **High Priority** – Critical features
- **Medium Priority** – Important enhancements
- **Low Priority** – Minor adjustments

---

### **5. Keeping the Scrum Board Updated**
- Review and update the Scrum Board **weekly**.
- Move completed tasks to **Done**.
- Ensure all team members **log updates regularly**.
- The Scrum Board will be used for our **weekly PPP reports**.
